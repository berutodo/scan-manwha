# Scans Manwha

- Made with Selenium
- Save your manwha in folders

### How 
**Firstly, you need to find a service that provides Manwhas or Manga pages, there are several scans that provide this service.**

**There are some instructions in the code, follow them to configure.**

**Everything works with selenium and python, so make sure both are installed.**

**The program takes a screenshot of each page and stores it in folders for better organization.**

**It is recommended that the service you are going to consume shows one page at a time, to avoid having to make cuts. Some scans have CDN pages to store the images, use this to your advantage.**
